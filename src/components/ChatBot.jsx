    response: `🤖 **How WebGI AI Recommendations Work:**

**Hybrid Scoring Algorithm (0-100 Points):**

Our ML model analyzes each property and scores them:

1️⃣ **Price Match (25 points)**
   - Checks if property is within your budget
   - Closer to budget = Higher score
   - Considers price per person (capacity)

2️⃣ **Ratings & Reviews (30 points)** ⭐
   - Highly-rated properties score highest
   - Based on 0-5 star ratings
   - Recent reviews weighted more
   - Minimum 4+ stars gets full points

3️⃣ **Amenity Match (25 points)** 🏠
   - Checks for your required amenities
   - More matching amenities = Higher score
   - Weighs common amenities: WiFi, Food, AC, Parking
   - You select amenities, AI matches

4️⃣ **Availability/Vacancy (15 points)** 🔑
   - Properties with vacancies rank higher
   - Same-week availability bonus
   - Occupancy vs capacity considered

5️⃣ **Capacity Match (5 points)** 👥
   - Matches number of guests needed
   - Considers number of rooms/sharing type

**Total Score = 25+30+25+15+5 = 100 points**

**How the ML Model Works:**

📊 **Training Data:**
- 150+ rental properties in database
- Real user booking history

**Real-Time Processing:**

When you filter properties:
1. Frontend sends: City, budget, filters
2. ML server (Port 8001) receives request
3. Connects to MongoDB database
4. Scores ALL properties (0-100)
5. Sorts by score (highest first)
6. Returns top 100 recommendations
7. Saves results to recommendations.json
8. Frontend displays with match scores

**API Endpoint:**
