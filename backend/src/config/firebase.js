/**
 * DEPRECATED: Firebase configuration file
 * 
 * This file has been replaced with ImageKit for image storage.
 * ImageKit is simpler, faster, and has better free tier.
 * 
 * All image uploads now go through:
 * - Backend: /src/config/imagekit.js
 * - Controller: /src/controllers/propertyController.js (uploadPropertyImages function)
 * 
 * Do not use this file. It is kept for reference only.
 */

// ImageKit is now used instead. See /src/config/imagekit.js
